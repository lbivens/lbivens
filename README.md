I am a self declared citizen of the world whose interests range from computing to philosophy, passing through cooking, rocketry, ham radio, photography, and contemporary dancing. I have opinions for everything - not unlike most people - and I like to voice them looking for a good old fashioned debate over coffee. I enjoy spending quality time with my family, and friends. 

I've been working with computers for 20+ years, and I often spend time wondering why are we still solving the same problems over and over again. With the leftover time I tinker and fiddle with everything I find interesting in the universe, sometimes putting my curiosity to practical use, sometimes just enjoying knowledge for the sake of it.

I am passionate about software that reduces complexity, I am a user of tools that make things simple. Instead of spending time doing "the thing", I'd rather build the tool that will do "the thing" for me, and others... This time, and forever...

If you are thinking about 3D printing paella, writing a new operating system, charting a new solar system, or anything really... You should definitely contact me, I am sure we will have a good chat.
